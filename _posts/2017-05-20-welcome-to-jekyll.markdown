You have a small to medium size business, and you have software needs. You need a website, you need a mobile app, or maybe you need both. You could be at the nascent stages of your business. Or you may already have a solution in hand, perhaps a tech company handed you the keys two years ago, and now you'd like to make some improvements.

No matter which of these cases describes you, there is one common factor: you need to find the right technology partners to create a long term relationship. Nearly every software development firm will tell you they're a great fit. After all, you're amazing, and they want your business!

But not every technology firm is actually a good fit for you.
